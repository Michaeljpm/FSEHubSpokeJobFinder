# FSEHubSpokeJobFinder
A script to find green jobs going to and from airports in FSEconomy

Uses Python 2.7

## How to Use:

Open with python and enter your airport ICAO (usually a Hub) then enter the minimum amount of jobs you want going to and coming from each airport. If it's your first time running the program, you will need to enter your access key which can be found [here] (server.fseconomy.net/datafeeds.jsp). The access key is stored in Accesskey.txt if you ever need to change it. The program will give you a list of airports that match the criteria. Enjoy!

**Note** This program only shows green (user generated) jobs

### Plans for version 1.1
- Add Minimum passengers instead of jobs
